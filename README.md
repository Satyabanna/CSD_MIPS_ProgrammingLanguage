# Grammar Rules and Syntactic Structure of KIK Language

KIK is a procedural programming language, with syntax for control structures (using colons after conditions), data types, constants, and input/output operations. Programs begin with a main function `int kik() { ... }`, supporting declarations, statements, and additional functions. Imports (e.g., `import "io.kik";`) enable custom I/O functionality. The grammar is defined in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), where terminals are quoted (e.g., `"int"`), non-terminals are in angle brackets (e.g., `<identifier>`), `{ ... }*` denotes zero or more repetitions, `{ ... }*` denotes one or more, `|` separates alternatives, and `[ ... ]` indicates optional elements.

Here, we go with all grammars for KIK language . . . .

## 1. Program Structure

A KIK program consists of optional imports, a mandatory main function, and optional additional functions or declarations.

```ebnf
<program> ::= { <import> }* <main-function> { <function> | <declaration> }*
<import> ::= "import" <string-literal> ";"
<main-function> ::= "int" "kik" "(" ")" "{" <statement>* "return" <expression> ";" "}"
<function> ::= <type> <identifier> "(" [ <parameter-list> ] ")" "{" <statement>* "}"
<parameter-list> ::= <parameter> { "," <parameter> }*
<parameter> ::= <type> <identifier>
```

Notes: The main function returns an integer (e.g., `return 0;`). Additional functions follow similar syntax.

## 2. Data Types

KIK supports primitive types (`int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`) and strings (via `str` or `char` arrays). Booleans use `true` or `false`.

```ebnf
<type> ::= "int" | "float" | "double" | "char" | "bool" | "str" | "void"
<array-type> ::= "char" <identifier> "[" <integer-literal> "]"
<boolean-literal> ::= "true" | "false"
```

Examples:

```kik
int age = 25;
float height = 5.9;
char grade = 'A';
bool isStudent = true;
str firstName;
char name[100];
```

## 3. Declarations

Variables can be declared with or without initialization. Multiple variables in a single declaration initialize only the last variable unless explicitly assigned. Constants use the `constant` keyword.

```ebnf
<declaration> ::= [ "constant" ] <type> <var-list> ";"
<var-list> ::= <var-init> { "," <var-init> }*
<var-init> ::= <identifier> [ "=" <expression> ]
```

Multiple Variables:

Syntax: `<type> var1, var2, var3 = value;` (only `var3` is initialized; `var1`, `var2` are uninitialized).
Explicit initialization: `a = b = c = 10;`.

Constants:

Syntax: `constant [type] constantName = value;`
Examples: `constant price_apple = 1.50;` (type inferred), `constant float price_banana = 0.75;`.

## 4. Expressions

Expressions include literals, variables, operators, function calls, string concatenation, and array access. Operator precedence mirrors major programming language (e.g., `*`, `/` before `+`, `-`).

```ebnf
<expression> ::= <assignment-expr> | <logical-expr> | <comparison-expr> | <arithmetic-expr> | <unary-expr> | <primary-expr>
<primary-expr> ::= <identifier> | <literal> | "(" <expression> ")" | <function-call> | <string-concat> | <array-access>
<literal> ::= <integer-literal> | <float-literal> | <char-literal> | <string-literal> | <boolean-literal>
<integer-literal> ::= [ "-" ] <digit>+
<float-literal> ::= [ "-" ] <digit>* "." <digit>+
<char-literal> ::= "'" <character> "'"
<string-literal> ::= '"' { <character> }* '"'
<arithmetic-expr> ::= <expression> ("+" | "-" | "*" | "/" | "%") <expression>
<comparison-expr> ::= <expression> ("==" | "!=" | ">" | "<" | ">=" | "<=") <expression>
<logical-expr> ::= <expression> ("&&" | "||") <expression> | "!" <expression>
<assignment-expr> ::= <identifier> ("=" | "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/=" | "%=") <expression>
<function-call> ::= <identifier> "(" [ <arg-list> ] ")"
<arg-list> ::= <expression> { "," <expression> }*
<string-concat> ::= <expression> "+" <expression>
<array-access> ::= <identifier> "[" <expression> "]"
<array-assign> ::= <identifier> "[" <expression> "]" "=" <expression>
```

Operators:

Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
Assignment: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`.
Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` (return `bool`).
Logical: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).

String Operations:

Declaration: `str name;`
Concatenation: `str result = string1 + string2;`
Access/Modify: `char c = str[0];`, `str[0] = 'X';`.

## 5. Statements

Statements include declarations, assignments, I/O operations, control structures, and control flow keywords.

```ebnf
<statement> ::= <declaration> | <expression> ";" | <io-statement> | <if-statement> | <switch-statement> | <loop-statement> | "return" <expression> ";" | "break;" | "continue;"
```

Input/Output:

Uses major programming language-style `cout << expr << endl;` and `cin >> var;`, or custom `io.kik` functions: `input()` (returns string), `output(message)`.

```ebnf
<io-statement> ::= "cout" "<<" <expression> { "<<" <expression> }* [ "<<" "endl" ] ";"
| "cin" ">>" <identifier> { ">>" <identifier> }* ";"
| "output" "(" <expression> ")" ";"
| <identifier> "=" "input" "(" ")" ";"
```

## 6. Control Structures

Control structures use a colon (`:`) after conditions or expressions, distinguishing KIK from major programming language.

If-Else:

```ebnf
<if-statement> ::= "if" <expression> ":" "{" <statement>* "}"
{ "else if" <expression> ":" "{" <statement>* "}" }*
[ "else" ":" "{" <statement>* "}" ]
```

Example: `if score >= 90: { cout << "Grade: A"; } else if score >= 80: { ... } else: { ... }`

Switch-Case:

```ebnf
<switch-statement> ::= "switch" <expression> ":" "{"
{ "case" <literal> ":" <statement>* "break;" }*
[ "default" ":" <statement>* ] "}"
```

Example: `switch day: { case 1: dayName = "Monday"; break; ... default: ... }`

Loops:

While:

```ebnf
<while-loop> ::= "while" <expression> ":" "{" <statement>* "}"
```

Example: `while count <= 5: { cout << count; count++; }`

Do-While:

```ebnf
<do-while-loop> ::= "do" "{" <statement>* "}" "while" <expression> ":" "{" "}"
```

Example: `do { cout << count; count++; } while count <= 5: { }` (empty block after colon).

For:

```ebnf
<for-loop> ::= "for" <initialization> ";" <expression> ";" ":" <increment> ":" "{" <statement>* "}"
<initialization> ::= [ <type> ] <assignment-expr>
<increment> ::= <expression>
```

Example: `for int count = 1; count <= 5;: count : { cout << count; }`

Nested Loops: For loops can be nested, e.g., `for int i = 1; i <= 5; i++ : { for int j = 1; j <= 5; j++ : { ... } }`

Break and Continue:

`break;` (exits loop or switch).
`continue;` (skips to next iteration).

## 7. Identifiers and Literals

```ebnf
<identifier> ::= <letter> { <letter> | <digit> | "_" }*
<digit> ::= "0".."9"
<letter> ::= "a".."z" | "A".."Z"
<character> ::= any printable character except "'" or '"'
```

Semantics:

KIK is statically typed. Uninitialized variables have undefined values.
Division by zero or invalid operations cause runtime errors.
Strings are mutable via index access.


## 8. Functions
 
 ### Function Declaration
```cpp=
## Basic function syntax
returnType functionName(parameterType parameterName): {
    ## Function body
    return value;
}
```
Example: Simple Function

    return a + b;
}

int kik() {
    ## Function call
    int sum = add(5, 7);
    cout << "The sum is: " << sum << endl;  ## Output: 12
    return 0;
}
```

    return 0;
}
```
### Pass By Reference
```cpp=
## Function with pass by reference
void increment(int& value): {
    value++;  ## Modifies the original variable
}

int kik() {
    int number = 10;
    cout << "Original number: " << number << endl;  ## Output: 10
    
    increment(number);  ## Pass by reference

    return 0;
}
```
### Variable Scope
#### Local Scope
```code=
int kik() {
    int localVar = 10;  ## Local variable
    cout << "Local variable: " << localVar << endl;  ## Output: 10
    return 0;
}
```

#### Global Variable

```cpp=
int globalVar = 20;  ## Global variable

int kik() {
    cout << "Global variable: " << globalVar << endl;  ## Output: 20

    return sum * 2;  ## Return value
}

int kik() {
    int x = 5, y = 3;
    int result;
    
    ## Function call
    int doubleSum = calculate(x, y, result);
    
    cout << "Sum: " << result << endl;  ## Output: 8
    cout << "Double sum: " << doubleSum << endl;  ## Output: 16
    cout << "Function called " << globalCounter << " time(s)" << endl;  ## Output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```


## Sample code --> factorial.kik - KIK Program to Calculate Factorial of a Number

```
import "io.kik";

int kik() {
int factorial = 1;
output("Enter a positive integer: ");
number = input();
## Convert string input to integer (assuming input is valid)
int num = 0;
for int i = 0; i < number.length(); i++: {
num = num * 10 + (number[i] - '0');
}
if num < 0: {
cout << "Error: Please enter a non-negative number!" << endl;
return 1;
}
## Calculate factorial using a loop
for int i = 1; i <= num; i++: {
factorial *= i;
}
cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial << endl;
return 0;
}
```

## 9. Recursion

Sample code for factorial calculation using recursion
```cpp=
import "io.kik";

## Recursive factorial function
int factorial(int n) {
    if n <= 1: {
        return 1;  ## Base case
    } else: {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);  ## Recursive case
    }
}

int kik() {
    output("Enter a number to calculate its factorial: ");
    str inputStr = input();
    
    ## Convert string to integer
    int num = 0;
    for int i = 0; i < inputStr.length(); i++: {
        num = num * 10 + (inputStr[i] - '0');
    }
    
    if num < 0: {
        output("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.");
        return 1;
    }
    
    int result = factorial(num);
    output("Factorial of " + num + " is " + result);
    
    return 0;
}
```


## 10. ENUM

### Declaration rule 

 ```cpp=
<declaration> ::= <var_declaration> | <const_declaration> | <class_definition> | <struct_definition> | <enum_definition> ;
```
### Rules
```cpp=
<enum_definition> ::= "enum" <identifier> ":" "{" <enum_constants> "}" ";" ;
<enum_constants> ::= <identifier> { "," <identifier> }* ;
```
### <type> Rule
    
```cpp=
    <type> ::= "int" | "float" | "double" | "char" | "bool" | "str" | "void" | <identifier> ;
```
        
        
### Example of ENUM in kik 
        
```cpp=
   import "io.kik";

// Define an enum for days of the week
enum Day: {
    Sunday,
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday
};

int kik() {
    // Declare a variable of the 'Day' enum type
    Day today;
    
    // Assign a constant value to the enum variable
    today = Wednesday;

    // Use a switch-case statement to check the enum value
    switch today: {
        case Sunday: {
            cout << "Today is Sunday." << endl;
        }
        case Monday: {
            cout << "Today is Monday." << endl;
        }
        case Tuesday: {
            cout << "Today is Tuesday." << endl;
        }
        case Wednesday: {
            cout << "Today is Wednesday." << endl;
        }
        case Thursday: {
            cout << "Today is Thursday." << endl;
        }
        case Friday: {
            cout << "Today is Friday." << endl;
        }
        case Saturday: {
            cout << "Today is Saturday." << endl;
        }
        default: {
            cout << "Unknown day." << endl;
        }
    }

    // You can also use the enum value in a calculation or print it directly.
    // The enum value will be treated as its underlying integer type.
    cout << "The numeric value of 'Wednesday' is: " << Wednesday << endl; // Outputs: 3

    return 0; // Indicate successful execution
}
```
## 11.  Type Casting

Type casting in KIK allows conversion between compatible data types (e.g., int, float, char, bool, str). KIK supports both implicit and explicit type casting, enabling flexible data manipulation while maintaining type safety.


### Implicit Type Casting 

*  Syntax: dataType newVariable = existingVariable;
* Description: Automatically converts a variable to the target type when the conversion is safe (widening), such as from int to float. No explicit notation is required, and the conversion preserves the value with necessary adjustments (e.g., adding a decimal point for float).
* Use Case: Useful when assigning a smaller data type to a larger one, like int to float, where data loss is not a concern.
* Semantics: The compiler handles the conversion, ensuring compatibility. For example, assigning an int value of 5 to a float results in 5.0.

 
```kik=
## implicit_casting.kik - Simple Implicit Type Casting
int kik() {
    int intValue = 5;       ## Integer value
    float floatValue;       ## Float variable
    floatValue = intValue;  ## Implicitly converts int to float
    cout << "Integer: " << intValue << ", Float: " << floatValue << endl;  ## Outputs: Integer: 5, Float: 5.0
    return 0;               ## Indicate successful execution
}
```

### Explicit Type Casting

* Syntax: dataType newVariable = (dataType) existingVariable;
* Description: Forces conversion to the target type, even if it may result in data loss (narrowing), such as from float to int. The target type is specified in parentheses before the variable.
* Use Case: Required for conversions that may lose precision, like float to int, where the decimal part is truncated.
* Semantics: The programmer explicitly indicates the desired type. For example, casting a float value of 7.8 to int yields 7.

```kik=
## explicit_casting.kik - Simple Explicit Type Casting
int kik() {
    float floatValue = 7.8;  ## Float value
    int intValue;            ## Integer variable
    intValue = (int) floatValue;  ## Explicitly converts float to int
    cout << "Float: " << floatValue << ", Integer: " << intValue << endl;  ## Outputs: Float: 7.8, Integer: 7
    return 0;                ## Indicate successful execution
}
```

## 12. Exception Handling
Exception handling in KIK provides a mechanism to manage runtime errors gracefully using try, catch, and throw constructs, ensuring robust program execution.

* Syntax:

```ebnf=
<try-catch-statement> ::= "try" ":" <statement>* ":" <catch-block>+
<catch-block> ::= "catch" "(" <type> <identifier> ")" ":" <statement>* ":"
<throw-statement> ::= "throw" <expression> ";"
```
* Description:
     * try:Encloses a block of code that may throw an exception. The block is delimited by colons (:).
    * catch: Handles exceptions thrown in the try block, specifying the exception type (e.g., int, str) and an identifier to access the thrown value. Multiple catch blocks can handle different exception types.
    * throw: Raises an exception with a specified value (e.g., throw 0; or throw "Error message";).

* Use Case: Used to handle errors like division by zero, invalid input, or file access failures, preventing program crashes.
* Semantics: When an exception is thrown, control transfers to the matching catch block. If no matching catch is found, the program terminates with a runtime error. The catch block processes the exception and continues execution.

 ```kik=
 ## division.kik - Simple Exception Handling
import "io.kik";

int kik() {
    float number = 10.0;
    float divisor;
    float result;
    output("Enter a divisor: ");
    divisor = input();  ## Assume input is converted to float
    try:
        if divisor == 0:
            throw "Zero divisor";
        result = number / divisor;
        cout << "Result: " << result << endl;  ## Outputs result if no exception
    :
    catch (str error):
        cout << "Error: " << error << endl;  ## Outputs: Error: Zero divisor
    :
    return 0;  ## Indicate successful execution
}
```
    
    


## 13. Files

File pointer 
```cpp=
 filePointer file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
```
File read 
```cpp=
fread(dataPointer, size, count, filePointer); ## Read data from the file
```

File write 
```cpp=
fwrite(filePointer, dataPointer, size, count);
## Write data to the file
```

File close 
```cpp=
   fclose(file);
```


#### Sample code for file operations 
```kik
import "file.kik";  // Assuming file operations are in this module

int kik() {
    // Data to write to the file
    str data = "Hello, Kik! This is a file operation example.";
    int dataSize = data.length();  // Get string length

    // Open the file in write mode
    filePointer file = fopen("example.txt", "w");
    if file == NULL: {
        cout << "Error opening file for writing." << endl;
        return 1;  // Indicate failure
    }

    // Write data to the file
    fwrite(file, data, 1, dataSize);  // Write characters one by one
    fclose(file);  // Close the file

    // Open the file in read mode
    file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    if file == NULL: {
        cout << "Error opening file for reading." << endl;
        return 1;  // Indicate failure
    }

    // Buffer to read data from the file
    char buffer[256];  // Buffer to hold read data
    fread(buffer, 1, dataSize, file);  // Read dataSize characters
    buffer[dataSize] = '\0';  // Null-terminate the string
    fclose(file);  // Close the file

    // Display the read data
    cout << "Read from file: " << buffer << endl;
    return 0;  // Indicate successful execution
}

```

## 14. Structures (struct)
This section provides a complete specification for user-defined structures in the KIK language. Structures are a powerful feature for grouping related data into a single, custom data type.

### 14.1. Design and Purpose
A *structure* is a composite data type that allows you to bundle together variables of different types under a single name. This is useful for creating logical records, such as representing a student with an ID, name, and GPA, or a point with x and y coordinates.

The design of KIK's struct is aligned with its C++ heritage and is stylistically consistent with the class definition, using KIK's signature colon (:) to introduce the body. By default, all members of a struct are *public*.

### 14.2. Feature Specification

#### Syntax for Definition
A struct is defined using the struct keyword, a unique name for the new type, a colon, a body of member variables enclosed in curly braces ({}), and a terminating semicolon (;).

```kik
// Defines a new custom type named 'Student'
struct Student: {
    int student_id;
    str name;
    float gpa;
};

// Defines a new custom type named 'Point'
struct Point: {
    int x;
    int y;
};

```

### Variable Declaration
Once a struct type has been defined, you can declare variables of that type just like any primitive type.

// Declares a variable 's1' of type 'Student'
``` 
Student s1;
```
// Declares and initializes a variable 'origin' of type 'Point'
```
Point origin;
```

### Member Access
The members of a struct variable are accessed using the dot (.) operator. If you have a pointer to a struct (a feature from the Pointers & References module), you would use the arrow (->) operator.

```
// Create a Student variable
Student s1;

// Assign values to its members using the dot operator
s1.student_id = 101;
s1.name = "Ojas Ghambeera";
s1.gpa = 3.8;

// Read a value from a member
output("Student Name: ");
output(s1.name);

// Conceptual example of pointer access
// Student* s_ptr = &s1;
// s_ptr->gpa = 4.0;

```

## 14.3. Grammar Rules (EBNF)
The following grammar rules are added to the KIK language specification to support structures

```// 1. Modify the <declaration> rule to include struct definitions.
// This allows a struct to be defined anywhere a variable or class can be.
<declaration> ::= <var_declaration> 
                | <const_declaration> 
                | <class_definition> 
                | <struct_definition> ;

// 2. Add the new rule for a struct definition.
// It consists of the 'struct' keyword, a name, a colon, and a list of member variables.
<struct_definition> ::= "struct" <identifier> ":" "{" { <member_variable> }* "}" ";" ;

// 3. Define the rule for a member variable inside a struct.
// This reuses the existing rule for variable declarations.
<member_variable> ::= <type> <var-list> ";" ;

// 4. Modify the expression grammar to include member access.
// This adds the dot and arrow operators.
<primary-expr> ::= <identifier> 
                 | <literal> 
                 | "(" <expression> ")" 
                 | <function-call>
                 | <array-access>
                 | <member-access> ;

// 5. Add the new rule for member access expressions.
<member-access> ::= <primary-expr> "." <identifier>
                  | <primary-expr> "->" <identifier> ;

```

## 14.4. Complete Test Case
This sample program demonstrates the definition, declaration, initialization, and use of a struct in KIK. It shows how struct variables can be used and passed to functions.

```
 * KIK Language - Structure Test Case
 * This program defines a 'Rectangle' struct, creates an instance,
 * calculates its area, and prints the details.
 */

// 1. Define a 'Rectangle' struct with width and height members.
struct Rectangle: {
    int width;
    int height;
};

// 2. A helper function that takes a Rectangle struct as a parameter.
void printRectangleInfo(Rectangle rect) {
    output("--- Rectangle Info ---");
    output("Width: ");
    output(rect.width);
    output("Height: ");
    output(rect.height);

    // Calculate the area inside the function
    int area = rect.width * rect.height;
    output("Area: ");
    output(area);
}

// Main program entry point
int kik() {
    // 3. Declare a variable 'rect1' of our new 'Rectangle' type.
    Rectangle rect1;

    output("Initializing rectangle...");

    // 4. Assign values to the members of the 'rect1' variable.
    rect1.width = 20;
    rect1.height = 30;

    // 5. Pass the struct variable to our helper function.
    printRectangleInfo(rect1);

    return 0;
}
```
# 15. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Features

This section details the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features for the KIK language. The design aligns with the existing C++-inspired procedural nature of KIK, extending its syntax to support modern OOP paradigms. The goal is to provide a powerful, intuitive, and consistent set of features for creating complex, modular programs.

This module covers the design and implementation of:

- Classes and Objects
- Access Modifiers (public, private)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (virtual, override)

## 15.1. Design Philosophy

The OOP syntax is designed to be a natural extension of KIK’s core style. It maintains a strong C++ influence for familiarity while integrating KIK's unique use of the colon (:) to introduce code blocks. This creates a consistent feel across procedural and object-oriented code within the language.

## 15.2. Feature Specification

### 15.2.1. Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. The class definition begins with the `class` keyword, followed by the class name, KIK's signature colon (`:`), and a body enclosed in curly braces (`{}`). A semicolon is required after the closing brace.

Syntax:

```kik
class MyClass: {
    // member declarations
};
```

### 15.2.2. Access Modifiers

KIK supports encapsulation through access modifiers. Members are grouped into `public` and `private` sections, which are introduced by the keyword followed by a colon.

- `public::`: Members are accessible from anywhere.
- `private::`: Members are only accessible from within the class.

Syntax:

```kik
class Player: {
private:
    // This member can only be accessed by Player's functions
    int health;
public:
    // These members can be accessed from anywhere
    str name;
    void takeDamage(int amount);
};
```

### 15.2.3. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (base class). KIK uses the standard C++ syntax for public inheritance.

Syntax:

```kik
class Animal: {
public:
    int age;
};

// The Dog class inherits all public members from Animal
class Dog : public Animal: {
public:
    str breed;
};
```

### 15.2.4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. This is achieved through virtual functions.

- `virtual`: This keyword is used on a function in the base class to indicate that it can be overridden by derived classes.
- `override`: This keyword is used on a function in the derived class to state that it is intentionally replacing a virtual function from a base class. This acts as a safety check to prevent bugs from typos.

Syntax:

```kik
class Shape: {
public:
    // This function can be overridden
    virtual void draw();
};

class Circle : public Shape: {
public:
    // This function redefines the draw() function from Shape
    void draw() override;
};
```

## 15.3. Grammar Rule Additions (EBNF)

The following rules should be added to the main KIK grammar to support OOP features.

```ebnf
// A declaration can now also be a class definition.
<declaration> ::= <var_declaration> | <const_declaration> | <class_definition> ;

// The formal rule for a class definition
<class_definition> ::= "class" <identifier> [ <inheritance_specifier> ] ":" "{" { <class_member> }* "}" ";" ;

// The rule for specifying a base class for inheritance
<inheritance_specifier> ::= ":" "public" <identifier> ;

// A class member can be an access specifier or a member declaration
<class_member> ::= <access_specifier> | <member_declaration> ;
<access_specifier> ::= "public" ":" | "private" ":" ;

// Member declarations are standard function/variable declarations
// with optional 'virtual' and 'override' keywords for functions.
<member_declaration> ::= [ "virtual" ] <type> <identifier> "(" [ <parameter-list> ] ")" [ "override" ] ";"
                       | <type> <var-list> ";" ;
```

## 15.4. Complete Example

This program demonstrates all the newly designed OOP features working together.

```cpp=
// Base class with a virtual function
class Character: {
public:
    // This function can be overridden by derived classes
    virtual void introduce();
};

// Definition for the Character's function
// Note: The '::' scope resolution operator will be defined in a later module.
// For now, we assume a naming convention like ClassName_FunctionName.
void Character_introduce() {
    output("I am a generic character.");
}

// Derived class that inherits from Character
class Wizard : public Character: {
public:
    // Override the base class function for a specific implementation
    void introduce() override;
};

// Definition for the Wizard's function
void Wizard_introduce() {
    output("I am a powerful Wizard!");
}

// Main program entry point
int kik() {
    output("--- KIK OOP Demo ---");

    // The design for object creation ('new' keyword) and pointers
    // will be added in a future module. The following code is a
    // conceptual demonstration of how polymorphism would work.
    
    // Character* player1 = new Character();
    // Character* player2 = new Wizard();
    
    // player1->introduce(); // Expected Output: I am a generic character.
    // player2->introduce(); // Expected Output: I am a powerful Wizard!
    
    // delete player1;
    // delete player2;

    output("\nKIK program finished successfully.");
    return 0;
}
```

# 16. Memory Optimization

This section details the memory optimization features and best practices for the KIK language. A core design principle of KIK is to provide programmers with control over performance, and effective memory management is a key aspect of this. The features are designed to be powerful and explicit, drawing from the C++ heritage of manual and automated resource management.

### 16.1. Design and Purpose

The design of KIK's memory management features balances flexibility with safety. While the language provides direct control over dynamic memory via pointers and `new`/`delete` operators, it also introduces higher-level constructs like constructors and destructors to enable robust, automated cleanup. This allows programmers to choose the appropriate strategy—from fast, automatic stack allocation for local variables to flexible heap allocation for long-lived objects—while providing tools to prevent common errors like memory leaks.

### 16.2. Feature Specification

#### 16.2.1. Memory Allocation Models: Stack and Heap

KIK utilizes two primary memory regions for data storage: the **stack** and the **heap**.

* **Stack Allocation**: Memory for variables declared within a function's scope is allocated on the stack. This process is automatic and extremely fast. The memory is valid only for the lifetime of the function and is automatically released when the function returns. The stack should be the default choice for primitive types and small, function-local objects.
    ```kik
    int kik() {
        // 'stack_var' is allocated on the stack.
        int stack_var = 10;
        return 0; // 'stack_var' is automatically deallocated here.
    }
    ```

* **Heap Allocation**: Memory allocated with the `new` keyword resides on the heap, a region of memory available for dynamic, long-term storage. This memory remains allocated until it is explicitly freed using `delete` or `delete[]`. Heap allocation is essential for data that must outlive the scope in which it was created but requires careful manual management.
    ```kik
    int kik() {
        // 'heap_ptr' points to an integer allocated on the heap.
        int$ heap_ptr: new int;
        *heap_ptr = 20;

        // Memory must be manually freed to avoid a leak.
        delete heap_ptr;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

#### 16.2.2. Automatic Resource Management: Constructors and Destructors

To greatly simplify heap memory management and prevent leaks, KIK classes support constructors and destructors. This enables the powerful **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** pattern, where a resource's lifetime is bound to the scope of an object.

* A **constructor** is a special method invoked when an object is created, typically used to acquire resources like memory.
* A **destructor**, prefixed with a tilde (`~`), is a special method invoked just before an object is destroyed. It is the ideal place to release any resources the object acquired.

#### 16.2.3. Grammar Rule Additions (EBNF)

To integrate constructors and destructors, the `<class_member>` and `<member_declaration>` rules are updated:

```ebnf
// A declaration can now also be a class definition.
<declaration> ::= <var_declaration> | <const_declaration> | <class_definition> ;

// Update class_member to include member_declaration
<class_member> ::= <access_specifier> | <member_declaration> ;

// Update member_declaration to include constructor and destructor rules
<member_declaration> ::= [ "virtual" ] <type> <identifier> "(" [ <parameter-list> ] ")" [ "override" ] ";"
                       | <type> <var-list> ";"
                       | <constructor_declaration>
                       | <destructor_declaration> ;

// Rule for a constructor, which has the same name as the class
<constructor_declaration> ::= <identifier> "(" [ <parameter-list> ] ")" ":" "{" <statement>* "}" ;

// Rule for a destructor
<destructor_declaration> ::= "~" <identifier> "(" ")" ":" "{" <statement>* "}" ;
```

#### 16.2.4. Complete Example: RAII for Safe Memory Management

This sample program demonstrates how a class can use a constructor and destructor to safely manage a dynamic array, ensuring memory is always freed correctly.

```
/*
 * KIK Language - Automatic Memory Management Test Case
 * This program defines a 'MemorySafeArray' class that uses a
 * constructor to allocate memory and a destructor to free it,
 * demonstrating the RAII pattern.
 */

class MemorySafeArray: {
private:
    int$ data_ptr;
    int array_size;

public:
    // Constructor: Acquires memory when the object is created.
    MemorySafeArray(int size): {
        array_size = size;
        data_ptr: new int[array_size];
        output("Array allocated on the heap.");
    }

    // Destructor: Releases memory when the object is destroyed.
    ~MemorySafeArray(): {
        delete[] data_ptr;
        output("Array deallocated automatically. No memory leak!");
    }
};

// Main program entry point
int kik() {
    output("--- KIK RAII Demo ---");

    // 1. Create an object. Its constructor is called automatically.
    MemorySafeArray myArray(25);

    // ... perform operations with myArray ...
    
    // 2. When kik() finishes, 'myArray' goes out of scope.
    // Its destructor is called automatically, freeing the memory.
    return 0;
}
```

### 16.2.5. Pass-by-Reference for Efficiency

Passing large data structures (like `structs` or `classes`) to functions can be inefficient if done by value, as it requires creating a complete copy of the object. KIK supports pass-by-reference, which is a critical tool for memory optimization. Instead of copying the entire object, pass-by-reference sends only the object's memory address to the function.

Key Benefits:

Reduces Memory Usage: Avoids creating temporary, duplicate objects on the stack.

Improves Performance: Prevents the CPU overhead of copying large amounts of data.

Example: Optimizing Function Calls
Inefficient (Pass-by-Value): A full copy of `bigStruct` is created every time `processData` is called.

```
struct DataSet: {
    // Assume this struct contains a large amount of data
    int data[1000];
};

void processData(DataSet ds): {
    // 'ds' is a copy of the original struct.
    // ...
}
```

Only a memory address is passed, making the call fast and memory-friendly.

```
struct DataSet: {
    int data[1000];
};

void processData(DataSet& ds): {
    // 'ds' is a reference to the original struct, not a copy.
    // ...
}
```

# 17.Arrays and Multi-dimensional Arrays
    
This section details the specification for arrays in the KIK language. Arrays are a fundamental data structure for storing a fixed-size, sequential collection of elements of the same type. This feature is essential for a wide range of programming tasks, from simple data collection to complex algorithms.
    
### 17.1. Design Philosophy
    
The design of arrays in KIK is heavily inspired by their implementation in C/C++, ensuring consistency with the rest of the language's C-family heritage. However, the declaration syntax is updated to a more modern style.

* Modern Declaration: The array's size is logically grouped with the type (e.g., int[10]) rather than the variable name.
 
* Static Sizing: The size of an array must be a constant integer expression known at compile time.

* Zero-Based Indexing: The first element of an array is at index 0.
 
* Performance: KIK does not perform automatic runtime bounds checking. Accessing an array out of its defined bounds will lead to undefined behavior
    
### 17.2. Single-Dimensional Arrays
    
An array is declared by specifying the type of its elements, its size within square brackets [], and then the variable name.
    
#### Syntax
    
```
type[SIZE] array_name;
```

#### Example 
    
```
// Declares an array of 10 integers
int[10] scores;

// Declares an array of 50 floating-point numbers
float[50] temperatures;
```
### Initialization
Arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration using an initializer list enclosed in curly braces {}.
    
#### Syntax:
```
type[SIZE] array_name = { value1, value2, ... };
```

#### Examples:
```
// A fully initialized array
int[5] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

// A partially initialized array where the rest are default (0)
int[5] scores = {95, 88};
```
#### Element Access
Individual elements of an array are accessed using the subscript operator [] with the element's index.

#### Syntax:
```
array_name[index]
```
#### Example:
```
int[5] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

// Assign a new value to the first element
numbers[0] = 100;

// Read the third element
int third_number = numbers[2]; // will be 30
```
    
## 17.3.Multi-dimensional Arrays

Multi-dimensional arrays are "arrays of arrays" and are useful for representing grids or matrices.

### Declaration:
A multi-dimensional array is declared by providing multiple size specifiers
    
#### Syntax:
```
type[SIZE1][SIZE2]... array_name;
```
#### Example:
```
// Declares a 2D array (a 3x4 matrix) of integers
int[3][4] matrix;
```
    
### Initialization
Multi-dimensional arrays can be initialized using nested initializer lists.

#### Example:
```
// Initializes a 2x3 matrix
int[2][3] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},  // Row 0
    {4, 5, 6}   // Row 1
};
```
### Element Access
Elements are accessed by providing an index for each dimension.

#### Example:
``` 
// Accesses the element in row 1, column 2 (value is 6)
int val = matrix[1][2];
```
    
### Grammar Additions (EBNF)
The following rules should be integrated into the main KIK grammar.

```
// 1. Modify the <type> rule to include the array specifier.
// The size is now part of the type definition itself.
<type> ::= <base_type> [ <array_specifier> ] { "*" | "&" } ;

// 2. Add a rule for the array specifier.
// This allows for one or more dimensions.
<array_specifier> ::= "[" <expression> "]" { "[" <expression> "]" }* ;

// 3. The <var-init> rule is now simpler, as the array part is handled by the type.
<var-init> ::= <identifier> [ "=" <initializer> ] ;

// 4. The rule for an initializer list.
<initializer> ::= "{" <expression> { "," <expression> }* "}" ;

// 5. The rule for array element access.
<array-access> ::= <identifier> "[" <expression> "]" { "[" <expression> "]" }* ;
```   
    

#### Test Case 1: Single-Dimensional Array

```
// Purpose: Test single-dimensional arrays with the new KIK declaration syntax.
// Expected Output:
// Array elements: 5 10 15 20 25 
// Element at index 2 is now: 99

int kik() {
    int[5] my_array = {5, 10, 15, 20, 25};

    output("Array elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1): {
        output(my_array[i]);
        output(" ");
    }

    // Modify an element
    my_array[2] = 99;
    
    output("\nElement at index 2 is now: ");
    output(my_array[2]);

    return 0;
}    
                          
```    
#### Test Case 2: Multi-dimensional Array
```
// Purpose: Test 2D arrays (matrices) with the new KIK declaration syntax.
// Expected Output:
// Matrix:
// 1 2 3 
// 4 5 6 

int kik() {
    int[2][3] matrix = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };

    output("Matrix:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i = i + 1): {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j = j + 1): {
            output(matrix[i][j]);
            output(" ");
        }
        output("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}                          
``` 
                              
                              
# 18. Dynamic Memory Allocation 

Dynamic memory allocation in KIK allows runtime allocation and deallocation of memory using new and delete, supporting both single variables and arrays.

* Syntax:

```ebnf=
<dynamic-memory-statement> ::= <type> "$" <identifier> ":" "new" <type> [ "[" <expression> "]" ] ";" 
                             | "delete" <identifier> ";" 
                             | "delete[]" <identifier> ";"
```
* Description:
  * Declaration: Pointers are declared with a $ symbol (e.g., int$ ptr;).
  * Allocation:
    * new dataType; allocates memory for a single variable (e.g., int$ ptr: new int;).
    * new dataType[size]; allocates memory for an array (e.g., int$ arr: new int[5];).
  * Deallocation:
     * delete ptr; frees memory for a single variable.
    * delete[] arr; frees memory for an array
 * Dereference: Use *ptr to access or modify the value at the pointer's address (e.g., *ptr = 42; or value = *ptr;).
* Use Case: Enables flexible memory management for variables and arrays whose size is determined at runtime, such as dynamic arrays or objects.

* Semantics: Memory allocated with new resides on the heap and must be explicitly deallocated with delete or delete[] to prevent memory leaks. Accessing a pointer after deletion or dereferencing a null pointer causes runtime errors.


```kik=
## dynamic_memory.kik - Simple Dynamic Memory Allocation
int kik() {
    int$ ptr: new int;     ## Allocate memory for a single integer
    *ptr = 15;             ## Assign value
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;  ## Outputs: Value: 15
    delete ptr;            ## Deallocate memory
    
    int$ array: new int[3];  ## Allocate memory for an array
    array[0] = 1; array[1] = 2; array[2] = 3;  ## Assign values
    cout << "Array: " << array[0] << " " << array[1] << " " << array[2] << endl;  ## Outputs: Array: 1 2 3
    delete[] array;        ## Deallocate array
    return 0;              ## Indicate successful execution
}
```

# KIK Language Test Cases
### Test Case 1: Conditional Logic (if-else if-else)
This test demonstrates the use of an if-else if-else block to determine a grade based on a score.
```
Expected Output:
Grade: B
```   
   

---
                                         
```                                               
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int score = 85;
if score >= 90: {
cout << "Grade: A" << endl;
} else if score >= 80: {
cout << "Grade: B" << endl;
} else: {
cout << "Grade: C or lower" << endl;
}
return 0;
}
```


---


---

### Test Case 2: Basic Arithmetic
This test shows basic variable declaration, addition, and printing the result to the console.
```
Expected Output:
Final output after adding: 98
```
    

---
```
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int a = 8;
int b = 90;
int result = a + b;
cout << "Final output after adding: " << result << endl;
return 0;
}
```

### Test Case 3: Variable & Constant Declaration
This test verifies the syntax for declaring and initializing multiple data types, including the special rule for multi-variable lines and constants.
```
Expected Output:
Age: 25
Z value: 100
Hello!
```


---
```
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int age = 25;
float pi = 3.14;
bool isKik = true;
int x, y, z = 100;
constant str GREETING = "Hello!";
cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
cout << "Z value: " << z << endl;
cout << GREETING << endl;
return 0;
}
```
    
### Test Case 4: Operator Expressions
This test checks the evaluation of an arithmetic expression and a comparison operator within an if statement.
```
Expected Output:
Expression evaluated correctly!
```
    

---
```
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int result = (a * 2) + b;
if result == 25: {
cout << "Expression evaluated correctly!" << endl;
} else: {
cout << "Expression evaluation failed." << endl;
}
return 0;
}
```

### Test Case 5: Standard Input/Output (cin, cout)
This test demonstrates how to prompt a user for input and read it using cin, then display a formatted message using cout.
```
Expected Output (Interactive):
The program will prompt for a name and age, then print a personalized greeting.
```
    

---
```
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int userAge;
str userName;
output("Enter your name: ");
cin >> userName;
output("Enter your age: ");
cin >> userAge;
cout << "Hello, " << userName << "! You are " << userAge << " years old." << endl;
return 0;
}
```
    
### Test Case 6: do-while Loop
This test verifies the unique syntax of the KIK do-while loop, which requires an empty block {} after the condition.
```
Expected Output:
Starting do-while loop...
Counter is: 0
Counter is: 1
Counter is: 2
Loop finished.
```
    

---
```
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int counter = 0;
output("Starting do-while loop...");
do {
cout << "Counter is: " << counter << endl;
counter++;
} while counter < 3: { }
output("Loop finished.");
return 0;
}
```
                    
### Test Case 7: Basic Output Function
This test demonstrates the use of the output() function to print variables of different types.
 ```                   
Expected Output:
The score is: 100
Welcome to KIK!
```
                    

---
```
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int score = 100;
str message = "Welcome to KIK!";
output("The score is: ");
output(score);
output("\n");
output(message);
return 0;
}
```
                    
### Test Case 8: Simple if-else Statement
This test checks a basic if-else condition without parentheses around the expression.
 ```                   
Expected Output:
The number is positive.
 ```
 ```                   
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int number = 10;
if number > 0: {
output("The number is positive.");
} else: {
output("The number is not positive.");
}
return 0;
}
Test Case 9: for Loop
This test verifies the specific colon-based syntax of the KIK for loop.
Expected Output:
Counting: 0 1 2 3 4
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
output("Counting: ");
for int i = 0; i < 5;: i = i + 1: {
output(i);
output(" ");
}
return 0;
}
```
                      
###mTest Case 10: while Loop
This test demonstrates a basic while loop, showing a countdown.
 ```                     
Expected Output:
3 2 1 Liftoff!
 ```
 ```                     
import "io.kik";
int kik() {
int countdown = 3;
while countdown > 0: {
output(countdown);
output(" ");
countdown = countdown - 1;
}
output("Liftoff!");
return 0;
}
 ```
    
### Test Case 11: Function Definition and Call
This test shows how to define a separate function (multiply) and call it from the main kik function.
```    
Expected Output:
The product is: 12
```
    
```    
import "io.kik";
int multiply(int x, int y) {
return x * y;
}
int kik() {
output("The product is: ");
output(multiply(3, 4));
return 0;
}
```
